		<div>I understand that the massage given to me by ___________________ is for the purpose of (stress reduction, pain reduction, relief from muscle tension, increasing circulation, or specific reasons stated here).

I understand that the massage therapist does not diagnose illness or disease and does not prescribe medical treatment or pharmaceuticals, nor are spinal manipulations part of massage therapy.

I understand that massage therapy is not a substitute for medical care and that it is recommended that I work with my primary caregiver for any condition I may have.

I have stated all my known physical conditions and medications, and I will keep the massage therapist updated on any changes.

		<div>StoreWell is a mobil and web application for massage clients and their therapists who wish to organize information and evaluate the benefits and progress of their massage treatments. 

With 3 simple functions, we can help therapists organize their businesses and bring more value to their clients. 


1. Intake Form:  preliminary document to a clients chart. Through the use of an automated intake form, therapists have access to the contact as well as  medical information of their clients. 


2. SOAP notes: are the required documentation to be added to the clients chart. (SOAP is an acronym for subjective, objective, analysis or assessment, and plan) These notes document the medical history of the client,  treatments provided, and any recommendations given by the therapist.


3. Plan: the plan is really the most important part of this documentation for the client because it notes the personalized suggestions that the therapist has given for the client. Although client have rights to these SOAP notes, it is not not common for a therapist to send their client this information. StoreWell would like to change that and provide massage therapists an easy way to send their suggestions to their clients so that their clients can be motivated by their progress, and track the many benefits that massage has on their lives.
