An informed consent agreement provides an opportunity for you to convey in writing what the client should expect from a massage therapy session with you. It also states the limitations of what the client should expect. The information enables the client to choose whether or not to receive the services you provide, and acts as a safeguard in the event liability issues arise during or after the service is provided.

Information Included
The following information may be included on the informed consent agreement:

Description of your approach to massage, modality and techniques
Benefits, limitations and contraindications of massage
Possible outcomes (this should not imply any guaranteed outcome)
The nature of a session, including the process of disrobing and draping
Your credentials and areas of expertise
Scope of practice what you can and cannot do based on your credentials
Statement that you will maintain client confidentiality and privacy
Session duration and fees
Policies for cancellations and late arrival
Insurance reimbursement capabilities, if any
Availability and hours of operation

Use with Client Intake Form
The informed consent form is almost always used in conjunction with the client intake form, which the client completes on his or her first visit. In the client intake form, the client provides information regarding his or her health history. Essentially, the client intake form says, hereâ€™s all about me, and then in the informed consent agreement says, I understand what your services are, and I agree to receive them.
