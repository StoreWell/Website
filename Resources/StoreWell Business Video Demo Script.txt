StoreWell Demo for LegalAppathon Text:

StoreWell is a mobil and web application for massage clients and their therapists who wish to organize information and evaulate the benefits and progress of their massage treatments. 

With 3 simple fuctions, we can help therapits organize their businesses and bring more value to their clients. 

The intake form is the preliminary document to a clients chart. Through the use of an automated intake form, therapists have access to the contact as well as  medical information of their clients. 

The second funtion is for SOAP notes or the required documentation to be added to the clients chart. (SOAP is an acronym for subjective, objective, analysis or assessment, and plan) These notes docuemnt the medical history of the client,  treatments provided, and any recommendations given by the therapist.

The Plan is really the most important part of this documentation for the client because it notes the personalized suggestions that the therapist has given for the client. Although client have rights to these SOAP notes, it is not not common for a therapist to send their client this information. StoreWell would like to change that and provide massage therapists an easy way to send their suggestions to their clients so that their clients can be motivated by their progress, and track the many benefits that massage has on their lives.
