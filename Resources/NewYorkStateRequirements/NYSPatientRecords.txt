Do massage therapists maintain patient records?

Yes. Massage therapists must keep a record of client evaluations and treatments for six years or until the client turns 22, whichever is longer.

You have a right to your records and to have a copy of your records. The massage therapist who maintains your records can tell you how to obtain them.

Massage therapists must get your consent, or the consent of an authorized person, before releasing your records to anyone, except in circumstances provided for by the law.
