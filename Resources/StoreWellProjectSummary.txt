What is StoreWell?

StoreWell is a mobil and web application for massage therapists and their clients who wish to organize information and evaluate the benefits and progress of their massage treatments.

However, massage alone can not produce the benefits that come with good diet, exercise, and self care. We encourage and envision our users to be proactive and make informed decisions about their healthy futures.

With apps that can track eating and exercise habits, and wearable technologies that be used as heart monitors we believe that the possibilities for clients to track the benefits of massage therapy on their health are endless.
