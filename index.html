		<div>Given that StoreWell is a platform for massgage therapists and their clients, we must understand the legal terms for the massage therapy profession. These include national and state laws such as: license and registration, legal audits, HIPPA and agreements for the sharing of medical records, record keeping and record retention. 
This project is interested in the MIT Media Lab OpenPDS Initiative and the legal aspects of integration with user-centered identity services such as OpenIdConnect. xt</div>
